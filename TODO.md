# TODO: Enhance UI with More Responsive and Interactive Elements

## Information Gathered
- The app is a React-based management system for SK Tutorials using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons.
- Current UI includes responsive layout with sidebar toggle, stat cards, tab navigation, and dashboard widgets.
- Custom CSS classes provide skewmorphism shadows and basic styling.
- Tailwind config extends colors, shadows, and transitions.
- Components like Layout, Sidebar, Header, StatCard, TabNav, and Dashboard are key for enhancements.

## Plan
### 1. Enhance StatCard Component
- Add hover animations (e.g., scale and shadow increase).
- Include tooltips for additional info on hover.
- Improve responsiveness with better text sizing on small screens.

### 2. Improve Sidebar Responsiveness and Interactivity
- Add smooth slide-in/slide-out animations.
- Enhance active link states with better visual feedback.
- Add keyboard navigation support.

### 3. Upgrade Header Component
- Enable and enhance the search bar (currently commented out) with interactive search suggestions.
- Add user menu dropdown with smooth animations.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for the header elements.

### 4. Enhance TabNav Component
- Add smooth transitions between tabs.
- Include active tab indicators with animations.
- Make tabs more touch-friendly on mobile.

### 5. Improve Dashboard Page
- Add loading states with spinners for data fetching.
- Enhance grid layouts for better responsiveness across devices.
- Add interactive elements like expandable widgets or quick actions.

### 6. Overall UI Enhancements
- Add global hover effects and transitions using Tailwind.
- Implement focus states for accessibility.
- Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins) for better user experience.
- Update CSS classes in index.css for more interactive utilities.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `src/components/dashboard/StatCard.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

- `src/components/ui/TabNav.tsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/index.css`
- `tailwind.config.js` (if needed for additional utilities)

## Followup Steps
- Test the app on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure responsiveness.
- Run the app locally and use browser dev tools to verify animations and interactions.
- Check accessibility with tools like Lighthouse.
- If needed, add unit tests for interactive components.
